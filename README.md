# Polynomial
The specifications for this program were determined by the University of Washington. The implementation was executed by me, with the exception of the driver file, main.cpp, which was provided by the University. This program receives formatted polynomials and stores them into an array. The polynomial can then be operated on using addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
